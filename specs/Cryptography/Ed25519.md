# Ed25519

Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1

## Public key
```rust
pub struct ED25519PublicKey(pub [u8; ed25519_dalek::PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH]);
```

`ED25519PublicKey` is 32 bytes in size and represents a curve point in `CompressedEdwardsY` format:
```rust
/// In "Edwards y" / "Ed25519" format, the curve point \\((x,y)\\) is
/// determined by the \\(y\\)-coordinate and the sign of \\(x\\).
///
/// The first 255 bits of a `CompressedEdwardsY` represent the
/// \\(y\\)-coordinate.  The high bit of the 32nd byte gives the sign of \\(x\\).
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq)]
pub struct CompressedEdwardsY(pub [u8; 32]);
```

## Secret key

`ED25519SecretKey` is a 64 byte array representing a serialized keypair
```rust
// This is actually a keypair, because ed25519_dalek api only has keypair.sign
// From ed25519_dalek doc: The first SECRET_KEY_LENGTH of bytes is the SecretKey
// The last PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH of bytes is the public key, in total it's KEYPAIR_LENGTH
pub struct ED25519SecretKey(pub [u8; ed25519_dalek::KEYPAIR_LENGTH]);
```

## Signature
Signature wraps an instance of `ed25519_dalek::Signature`
```rust
/// An ed25519 signature.
///
/// # Note
///
/// These signatures, unlike the ed25519 signature reference implementation, are
/// "detached"—that is, they do **not** include a copy of the message which has
/// been signed.
#[allow(non_snake_case)]
#[derive(Copy, Eq, PartialEq)]
pub struct Signature {
    /// `R` is an `EdwardsPoint`, formed by using an hash function with
    /// 512-bits output to produce the digest of:
    ///
    /// - the nonce half of the `ExpandedSecretKey`, and
    /// - the message to be signed.
    ///
    /// This digest is then interpreted as a `Scalar` and reduced into an
    /// element in ℤ/lℤ.  The scalar is then multiplied by the distinguished
    /// basepoint to produce `R`, and `EdwardsPoint`.
    pub(crate) R: CompressedEdwardsY,

    /// `s` is a `Scalar`, formed by using an hash function with 512-bits output
    /// to produce the digest of:
    ///
    /// - the `r` portion of this `Signature`,
    /// - the `PublicKey` which should be used to verify this `Signature`, and
    /// - the message to be signed.
    ///
    /// This digest is then interpreted as a `Scalar` and reduced into an
    /// element in ℤ/lℤ.
    pub(crate) s: Scalar,
}
```

`ED25519SecretKey` is 64 bytes with the first 32 being the `ed25519_dalek::SecretKey` and last 32 an `ED25519PublicKey`
